## 📂 What Can I Do With Exported Markdowns?

- **Obsidian** — Import for your personal knowledge management system
- **VS Code** — View and edit with full markdown support
- **Notion** — Drag and drop the markdown file
- **Notes app** — Open directly on macOS
- **Feed to another AI** — Use your conversations as context in new chats

### Pro Tip: Navigation Trick

Exported files include a special `- ` prefix before headers (`###`, `####`) that makes them:
